# Email Verification System - Security Enhancement

## Overview
We've implemented a **two-step verification system** where email verification is **REQUIRED** for all users, with SMS verification as an optional secondary layer of security.

## Security Architecture

### Previous (INSECURE):
- Users without phones → NO verification at all ❌
- Temporary passwords sent via email in plain text ❌
- Accounts immediately active upon registration ❌

### New (SECURE):
- **ALL users** must verify email (primary security) ✅
- Optional SMS verification (enhanced security) ✅
- Accounts inactive until email verified ✅
- No passwords sent via email ✅

## Registration Flow

### Step 1: Account Creation
```
User fills registration form:
- Email (required)
- Name (required)
- Password (required)
- Phone (optional)
- SMS opt-in (optional)
```

### Step 2: Email Verification (REQUIRED)
```
1. Account created with is_active=False
2. 6-digit OTP sent to email
3. User enters code on verification page
4. Email marked as verified
5. If no phone → Account activated → Login
```

### Step 3: Phone Verification (OPTIONAL)
```
If user provided phone + opted for verification:
1. After email verified → Redirect to phone verification
2. 6-digit OTP sent via SMS
3. User enters code
4. Phone marked as verified
5. Account activated → Login
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `users/email_verification.py` - Email OTP service with rate limiting
- `users/email_views.py` - Email verification views
- `users/templates/users/email_verification.html` - OTP entry page
- `users/templates/users/emails/email_verification.html` - Email template

### Modified Files:
- `users/views.py` - Updated `register_applicant()` to require email verification
- `users/models.py` - Added `email_verified` and `email_verified_at` fields
- `users/urls.py` - Added email verification routes

## Key Features

### Email Verification Service
```python
class EmailVerificationService:
    OTP_LENGTH = 6
    OTP_EXPIRY_MINUTES = 10
    MAX_ATTEMPTS_PER_HOUR = 3
    MAX_ATTEMPTS_PER_DAY = 10
```

### Rate Limiting
- 3 verification attempts per hour
- 10 attempts per day
- Temporary blocking after exceeding limits

### OTP Security
- 6-digit random codes
- 10-minute expiration
- Single-use codes
- Cached securely in Django cache

## Testing the Flow

### 1. Test Registration:
```bash
# Navigate to:
http://localhost:8000/users/register/applicant/

# Fill form:
- Email: user@example.com
- Password: SecurePass123!
- Phone: (optional)

# Submit → Redirected to email verification
```

### 2. Check Email:
- Look for email with 6-digit code
- Enter code on verification page
- Account activated!

### 3. With Phone (Optional):
- If phone provided + "Verify phone" checked
- After email verification → Phone verification
- Enter SMS code
- Enhanced security enabled!

## Database Changes

### New Fields on User Model:
```python
email_verified = BooleanField(default=False)
email_verified_at = DateTimeField(null=True)
```

### Migration Applied:
```
users.0010_add_email_verification.py
```

## Email Templates

### Verification Email Features:
- Professional HTML design
- Clear 6-digit code display
- Purpose-specific messaging (registration/password reset/email change)
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Security notices
- 10-minute expiry warning

### Verification Page Features:
- Auto-submit on 6-digit entry
- Countdown timer
- Resend functionality with cooldown
- Progress indicator for multi-step flow
- Error animations
- Paste support

## API Endpoints

### Email Verification:
- `GET/POST /users/verify-email/<email>/` - Verify email with OTP
- `POST /users/resend-email-verification/` - Resend verification code

### SMS Verification (Optional):
- `GET/POST /users/verify-phone/<phone>/` - Verify phone with OTP
- `POST /users/resend-code/` - Resend SMS code

## Security Benefits

1. **No more plain-text passwords in emails** ✅
2. **All accounts require verification** ✅
3. **Rate limiting prevents abuse** ✅
4. **Two-factor option available** ✅
5. **TCPA compliant for SMS** ✅
6. **Audit trail for verifications** ✅

## Configuration

### Email Settings (SendGrid):
```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'applications.email_backends.SendGridBackend'
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'DoorWay <noreply@doorway.com>'
```

### SMS Settings (Telnyx):
```python
TELNYX_API_KEY = 'KEY...'
TELNYX_FROM_PHONE = '+1234567890'
TELNYX_PUBLIC_KEY = '...'
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor** verification success rates
2. **Add** email change verification flow
3. **Implement** password reset with email verification
4. **Consider** backup codes for account recovery
5. **Add** admin dashboard for verification metrics

## Success Metrics

- ✅ 100% of new accounts require email verification
- ✅ Zero passwords sent via email
- ✅ Optional SMS for enhanced security
- ✅ Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- ✅ Clean separation of email (required) and SMS (optional)
